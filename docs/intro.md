# What is SENTIO ?
Let's discover **SENTIO**.


Sentio, derived from Latin or "observe" and "analyze," introduces a
comprehensive 3-step security framework for deploying and
interacting with [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/).





## Why SENTIO

Sentio is designed to track and monitor your AO process. It deploys Sentinels which are responsible for overlooking and analyzing any interactions with AO. Sentio provides a comprehensive security framework for deploying and interacting with Arweave and AO. It consists of two main components:

- **PreDeployment Analysis**
- **PostDeployment Analysis**

### Sentinels
A Sentinal is a guard, a lookout these ***immortal*** beings are overseeing every transaction  . With Sentio, you get a fully customized process watcher that analyzes every transaction of your active process. This Customization consists of setting up Tags, Values, sender, Data of message and many more. Any transaction that does not meet the criteria set by you will be flagged and reported to you.


### PreDeployment Analysis

Sentio has a mechanism to audit your lua code that will be deployed on AO. It will analyze your code and provide you with a detailed report of the vulnerabilities and potential threats that your code might have. This will help you to fix the issues before deploying your code on AO.
### PostDeployment Analysis

The PostDeployement Analysis is the most important part of Sentio. It is responsible for monitoring the transactions that are happening on AO. It will analyze every transaction and will provide you with a detailed report of the transactions that are happening on AO. It will also provide you with the details of the transactions that are not meeting the criteria set by you. This will help you to keep your AO process secure and safe.
