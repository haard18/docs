# What is SENTIO ?

Let's discover **SENTIO**.

Sentio, derived from Latin or "observe" and "analyze," introduces a
comprehensive 3-step security framework for deploying and
interacting with [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) and [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/).





## Why SENTIO

Sentio is designed to track and monitor your AO process. It deploys Sentinels that provide two types of support:

- OffChain Analysis
- OnChain Analysis

### Sentinals
A Sentinal is a guard, a lookout, always watching over your AO process. With Sentio, you get a fully customized process watcher that analyzes every transaction of your active process.


### Off-Chain Analysis

Sentinels analyze your Lua code before deploying any contracts, finding vulnerabilities before your smart contracts go live.

### On-Chain Analysis

Sentinels monitor your AO process on-chain to track every transaction and ensure everything runs smoothly.


### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
